The sense of dread and the largely unspoken struggle for survival is completely engrossing as a viewer. Watch this without distractions and sit with the idea that 400,000 real soldiers stood at Dunkirk without any known esacape as axis powers closed in. Chilling, and amazing."},{"id":5,"title":"Eastern Promises","director":"David Cronenberg","lead_actors":["Viggo Mortensen","Naomi Watts","Vincent Castle"],"genres":["Drama","Action"],"youtube":"gAhz9OnL8Ps","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzU0OTY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzkwNjg2._V1_.jpg","runtime":100,"release_year":2007,"rating":8.2,"review":"An interesting take on organized crime channeled through the Russian mob. Though generally slower than your avergae mob movie, it feels comfortably paced, taking time to reflect on diasporic dynamics of Russian immigrants in America. Viggo Mortensen is a star in this role as well, absolutely deserved an Oscar."},{"id":6,"title":"Howl's Moving Castle","director":"Hayao Miyazaki","lead_actors":["Christian Bale","Jean Simmons","Patton Oswalt"],"genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Action"],"youtube":"iwROgK94zcM","poster":"https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/h9oAAOSw0BJgHam1/s-l1600.jpg","runtime":119,"release_year":2005,"rating":8.9,"review":"What more can be said about this classic Miyazaki film? Fantastic, absurd, sweet, and incomporably animated. Even the wicked witch's grotesque features are animated in a way only Ghibli can. Sophie's character gives us insight into the changes we incur as we age, Calcifer reminds us to keep our passions burning, and Howl reminds us to hold onto youthful idealism. Wonderful movie."},{"id":7,"title":"The Northman","director":"Robert Eggers","lead_actors":["Alexander Skarsg√•rd","Anya Taylor-Joy","Nicole Kidman"],"genres":["Drama","Thriller","Action"],"youtube":"oMSdFM12hOw","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlMmY2NTctODgwOC00NDMzLWEzMWYtM2RiYmIyNTNhMTI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAzNzgwNTg@._V1_.jpg","runtime":137,"release_year":2022,"rating":8.2,"review":"Not for the faint of heart. This movie will test your limits in what you can handle with gore and disturbing imagery. If you can get through that, Eggers delivers a great full-circle hero bent on vengeance story. Incorporating old Viking religion and feudal slave/master dynamics, this is a no holds barred approach to ancient Nordic storytelling."},{"id":12,"title":"Scarface","director":"Brian De Palma","lead_actors":["Al Pacino","Michelle Pfeiffer","Steven Bauer"],"genres":["Drama","Action"],"youtube":"7pQQHnqBa2E","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41-Wj-Z8DnL._AC_.jpg","runtime":170,"release_year":1983,"rating":8.7,"review":"A masterclass in film pacing, Scarface keeps you glues to your seat for all 2 hours and 50 minutes. Showing the rise and fall of an antisocial narcissist devoid of fear and hungry for power, this movie shows humanity at its utmost corruptible. Pacino is enthralling, and the backdrop of 1980's Miami at the height of the cocaine trade creates an environment within an organized crime movie unlike any other."},{"id":22,"title":"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent","director":"Tom Gormican","lead_actors":["Nicolas Cage","Nicolas Cage","Pedro Pascal"],"genres":["Comedy","Action"],"youtube":"x2YHPZMj8r4","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM2ODNiMWItOWRkNS00ODE3LWE2OGYtNTZkMDJkOWI1ODMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMxOTE0ODA@._V1_.jpg","runtime":105,"release_year":2023,"rating":7.4,"review":"Oh no, you read it right. I credited Nick Cage twice in this movie, because it fits. Nick Cage plays Nick Cage struggling to find a path forward in life after film relevancy, ultimately taking a Mallorca trip for a final gig where it becomes a buddy comedy with Pedro Pascal. Also, he's often visited by younger Nick Cage who screams at him to keep going. Then Nick Cage makes out with Nick Cage, and Nick Cage somehow becomes a CIA agent in the midst of it all. Despite what you just read, this was a very fun film. The interplay between Cage and Pascal is delightful, and somewhere along the way this strange film became cohesive and interesting. Worth watching for all who like absurdist, self-referrential comedy and fun, dumb action movies."}]
