Hyper-stylized, ultra-fast paced, very long, and does very little for character development. Complete overstimulation, and all narrated by one of the worst accents I have ever heard. It's one of those movies you think you've been watching for over an hour but it's only been twenty-five minutes. And it's nearly three hours long."}
