The black and white emphasizes the dread that overshadows the entire movie and is the perfect touch. The acting from Pattinson and Dafoe is sublime, with Dafoe giving one of the best monologues in cinema history. Watch two men descend into madness as they are overtaken by the solemn embrace of a godforsaken rock."},{"id":2,"title":"Elvis","director":"Baz Luhrmann","lead_actors":["Austin Butler","Tom Hanks","Olivia DeJonge"],"genres":["Musical","Drama"],"youtube":"wBDLRvjHVOY","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814DOk-0i3L.jpg","runtime":159,"release_year":2022,"rating":5.1,"review":"Austin Butler saves what is otherwise an unwatchable movie. Hyper-stylized, ultra-fast paced, very long, and does very little for character development. Complete overstimulation, and all narrated by one of the worst accents I have ever heard. It's one of those movies you think you've been watching for over an hour but it's only been twenty-five minutes. And it's nearly three hours long."}]
